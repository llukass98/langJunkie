## LangJunkie 
This project has been started as a helping tool in a language-learning process. It's currently under active development 
and many useful features are yet to come. 

#### version 0.2.3

### Implemented features at the moment:
* translation of the text on the fly by clicking on the word, 
this feature uses a group of dictionaries — so-called dictionary collections 
— so when you click on the word, those dictionaries are being requested 
and parsed simultaneously — this is achieved by using thread pool (currently only Persian to English language pair is supported, 
but more pairs will come in the future.)
* creation of flashcards for further reviewing (for now, you can only create, update or delete cards, 
integration with ANKI system or implementation of custom space repetition mechanism is planned) 
* "aggregated dictionaries" search to provide you with a definition of the word from multiple sources. 

### Features to come:
* more language pairs/collections
* translation of phrases
* language detection
* audio dictionaries
* uploading of the books in .epub and .txt format
* book reader
* better, not buggy frontend :)
* and more.
